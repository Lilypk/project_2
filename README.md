# Game Of War 

Game of War is a card game where the objective is to acquire all of the cards, which you can do in different ways. 

## Description 

To start the game, you need to open your console. The game is set up to play with two players. The card deck of 52 is shuffled and distributed evenly to each player, face down. Type 'newGame.compareCards()' in to your console. The game now starts. Each player puts down their first card with the value facing up. Whoever has the bigger valued card, takes all of the cards that were put down. If the cards are of equal value, war is declared. In war, each player will draw and put down four cards, facing the fourth card face up. Whoevers card is of higher value, takes all. If the cards are of equal value, war is declared again. The game is played until one player has all 52 cards. Your cards will be logged to the screen as Player Two or p2. This way, you can see each round you won, when war is declared, and who won each round.
